Ludum Dare 23: Tiny World
-------------------------

#### ideas

- A game in which you are a tiny world in a galaxy of other tiny worlds.
  Goal is to evolve society on your tiny world through indirect means to conquer other worlds.
  Populous/4x/???
- Standard platformer on which you explore a tiny world. Ooooh, original. Add minecraft elements for
  bonus points.
- Game in which you are a tribe of people on a tiny world and normal people land on it and start killing you.
  So you kill them back. SotC would be too ambitious for 48h. More like lemmings, mayhaps?
- Basketball game in which the ball is a tiny planet; your goal is to not dribble/shoot that much because
  it kills the natives.
- Odin Sphere/Mario Galaxy thingy. Too obvious?
- Mini Dwarf Fortess. Too ambitious?
